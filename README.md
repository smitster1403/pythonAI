# pythonAI

Hi so this is an AI I am currently working on to explore the LLM field.

Some of the packages I am building the AI in are Transformers, PyGame, speech_recognition, googsearch etc and this list will continue to grow.

The AI takes in speech prompts and uses a pattern matching approach to give responses that are preloaded and randomly selected using the numpy library.

For now I have managed to have the Ai tell me the time and be able to do a google search and return the first 10 links upon some google search prompt.

I intend to take this further to eventually get it to be more conversational and am looking to any resources available.
